# Hypar SDK
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hypar-io/sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hypar-io/sdk)

The Hypar SDK is a library for creating functions that execute on Hypar. A function is a piece of code that is executed in the cloud to build stuff. That stuff can be 3D geometry, which we store as glTF files, or data which we serialize to JSON and store in a document database. You create the function logic and publish the function to Hypar, then we execute it for you and store the results. The Hypar SDK provides object types that are useful for generating the built environment.

You can see some functions written using the Hypar SDK running on [Hypar Explore](https://explore.hypar.io/functions).

## Words of Warning
- The Hypar SDK is currently in beta. Please do not use it for production work.
- Why we chose C#:
  - C# is a strongly typed language. We want the code checking tools and the compiler to help you write code that you can publish with confidence. 
  - Microsoft is investing heavily in C# performance. There are lots of articles out there about Lambda performance. [Here's](https://read.acloud.guru/comparing-aws-lambda-performance-of-node-js-python-java-c-and-go-29c1163c2581) a good one.
  - Dotnet function packages are small. Smaller functions results in faster cold start times in serverless environments.
  - C# libraries can be reused in other popular AEC applications like Dynamo, Grasshopper, Revit, and Unity.

## Getting Started
- Contact beta@hypar.io to have an account created. Functions can be authored and executed locally. **A login is only required when publishing your function to the world!**
- Install [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/)
- Install the [Hypar CLI](https://github.com/hypar-io/sdk/tree/master/csharp/src/cli/).
- Install an IDE. Here's a couple of options:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a free IDE with great support for .net and python and it looks and acts the same on every platform (Mac, Linux, Windows), so it makes our job of supporting you slightly easier.
  - [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is great too, but it doesn't exist for Linux and is still learning to walk on the Mac.
- Clone the starter repo.  
```git clone https://github.com/hypar-io/dotnet-starter```. 
- `cd dotnet-starter`
- Edit the `hypar.json` file to describe your function. See [configuration](#configuration).
- Use the Hypar CLI to publish your function.
```
cd <function directory>
hypar publish
```
- Preview `.glb` models generated by Hypar locally using the [glTF Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-vscode), or [Don McCurdy's online glTF Viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/).

## Examples
The best examples are those provided in the [tests](https://github.com/hypar-io/elements/tree/master/test), where we demonstrate usage of almost every function in the library.

## Build
`dotnet build`

## Test
`dotnet test`
